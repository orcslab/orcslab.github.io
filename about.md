# About

The group's main research fronts are:

1. Optimization, including meta-heuristics, the development of algorithms for multi-objective problems, multi-criteria decision-making methods, and  matheuristics;
2. Statistical modeling and inference, including the development of protocols for experimental comparison of algorithms, reliability analysis and robustness modeling;
3. Specific applications, particularly in the electricity sector. We have carried out relevant projects with large distribution companies, such as the development of the strategic asset management system for CEMIG-D, and the integrated failure manager for Eletrobr√°s-CERON.

ORCS has relevant scientific production in the main journals and conferences in its areas and continuously contributes to the training of human resources at undergraduate and graduate levels.
