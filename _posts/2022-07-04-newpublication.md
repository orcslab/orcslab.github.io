Check out the abstract: *"Natural gas has been increasingly used as a source of energy and presents itself as a strong trend for the future. In this context, regarding the high cost of installing pipelines, the design of gas networks requires highlight quality solutions, relating not only financial indicators but also reliability and security concerning demand. Thus, this paper proposes an approach for the design of natural gas networks under conditions of uncertainty of load evolution over a time horizon. A predefined network topology is assumed, where the pipe diameters define the design variables. We propose a Multiobjective Variable Neighborhood Search (MOVNS)-based algorithm, which is evaluated considering a set of test instances defined from the TSPLIB library data. The proposed methodology is also applied to a real case study being the results compared to those obtained by three engineers of a gas company with six years of experience on average. The solutions are investigated from a dominance analysis perspective, considering the criteria: installation cost, minimum gas pressure, feasibility rate, average cost of failure, and sensitivity. The results indicate solutions relatively different from those obtained by the engineers, presenting more robust and safe networks under conditions of uncertainties of load evolution."*
