## Microwave Imaging

Microwave Imaging is an emerging field with many applications in biomedical engineering, through-the-wall imaging, geoscience, among others. The imaging problem is an instance of the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem, where the media is recovered by means of measurements of the scattered around the domain of interest. This is an ill-posed, nonlinear, and multimodal problem.

Our goal is to improve the algorithms and methods for measuring the performance of the reconstructions. We have also designed a library for algorithm development and performance experimentation.
